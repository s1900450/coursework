"You are woken by the sound of heavy footsteps approaching down the corridor. A key turns the lock of the cell door and two guards wearing chainmail enter, carrying food. ""Eat well, as you will need all the energy you can get today. You may be dead by the end"". The guard offers you some bread and soup. To take the food, type 1. To try overcome the guard, type 2."
The soup is thick with chicken and vegetables and tastes delicious. You devour it and now feel fit and ready for the upcoming ordeal. You are led away to begin your first day in the Arena of Death.
"You dive at the guard and send him crashing to the floor. Your cell mates stand there watching as the other guard locks the cell door. Realising your resistance is futile, you release the guard and await your punishment. You are led away and flogged by the guard you attacked, losing 4 STAMINA and 1 SKILL point. Your cell mates do what they can to address your wounds before you begin your first day in the Arena of Death."
"The sun is beating down, making the sand in the arena uncomfortably hot on your bare feet. ""You know why you are here"", Lord Carnuss begins. ""It is my wish to be represented in the Trial of Champions"". ""Some of you will die today, some tomorrow and until one of you is left. Those about to die, I salute you."" You are split into groups of seven and are told the first event is a race. With a burden of rocks strapped to your back, you must run around the makeshift racetrack with burning hot coals in one section of the track. You will race until one person collapses or is lapped. The race begins, and you all jostle on the way to the first pile of burning coals. If you wish to set the pace, type 1. If you would rather stay at the back, type 2."
"As you accelerate, a runner sticks his leg out and tries to trip you. Test your luck."
"One of the runners takes the lead, setting a quick pace. After twenty minutes, with everyone still standing, he increases the pace. Test your skill."
"You do not see the leg and trip over it, plummeting to ground. You jump up and quickly rejoin the pack, losing 2 STAMINA. The runner decides to sprint away. Test your skill."
"The weight of the rocks is weakening you, and on the next jump you twist your ankle and fall over. The other runners race ahead and are more than half a circuit ahead when you limp after them. Roll the dice."
"Your ankle is badly sprained, and the runners quickly run past you, ending the race. As they walk away back to their cells, a guard walks up to you and puts you out of your misery. GAME OVER."
"You see the leg just in time and manage to jump over it. You dictate the pace of the race to suit yourself. After twenty minutes, no one has fallen behind, and one of the runners decides to speed up. Test your skill."
"The runner increases his lead over everyone, As everyone sprints to catch up, you hear a loud cry followed by a shout, ending the race. You turn and see a runner laid in the sand. You head back to your cell as they are put out of their misery."
"Your ankle is only twisted and not sprained, and you force yourself to run hard, when suddenly a runner drops to the floor, ending the race. You head back to your cell as they are put out of their misery."
The bonecrusher manages to grab your sword and break it like a twig. You stand hopeless as it walks up to you and towers over your defenceless body. GAME OVER
"With incredible dexterity you dive at bonecrusher's leg, sending it crashing to the ground. Panting heavily with fatigue and relief, you are taken back to your cell."
"When all the races are finished and  the survivors are back in their cells, you notice someone is missing. The next day you are led to an arena and told to choose between 2 weapons."
"A guard opens the door to the arena and you step inside. Suddenly an arena wall opens and out steps the dreaded bonecrusher beast, its tough leathery skin glistening in the sun. Its torso is massive, and its long arms are dauntingly powerful. If you choose the sword and shield, type 1. If you choose the trident and net, type 2."
"You curse over your choice of weapon, but still know of one way to defeat the bonecrusher. Fight bonecrusher. (SKILL 9 STAMINA 10)"
"You smile, as you have chosen a good weapon for your adversary, You move forward cautiously to snare it with your weighted net. Roll the dice."
"The bonecrusher sniffs the air, sensing where you are standing, and moves to the left as you release the net. Lose 1 LUCK. Test your skill."
You are slow in gathering your net and the bonecrusher manages to grab one of your arms and break it like a twig. You watch and it towers over your defenceless body. GAME OVER.
"By the end of the day, only one other person returns to your cell. As the light fades, you hear the guard shout unexpectedly, ""There are now two of you in each cell, in the morning I only want one to be remaining."" You hear the guard laughing as he walks away, and before you know it, your cell mates comes charging at you brandishing a sharp pin from his headband. Fight easterner."
"Your throw is on target, ensnaring the bonecrusher as it crashes into the sand. The bonecrusher lies helpless and defeated. Panting with relief you are taken back to your cell. "
Your dexterity allows you to gather the net while avoiding the sweeping arms of bonecrusher. Once again you take aim and throw the net. Roll the dice.
You curse as once again your net floats harmlessly to the ground. Lose 1 LUCK. Test your skill.
"You slump against the cell wall after the fierce fight with the easterner and fall asleep from exhaustion, with little knowledge of what the next day will bring..."
"You slip, and the easterner inflicts a fatal wound in your lung. You slump down and sit gasping for air as the world falls pitch black. GAME OVER"
